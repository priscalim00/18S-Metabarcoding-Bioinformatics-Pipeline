# 18S-Metabarcoding-Bioinformatics-Pipeline

This pipeline has been designed for 18s amplicon sequencing data. 
## Step 1: Demultiplexing of reads & trimming of primers 
If sequencing facility provided demultiplexed reads, this step can be skipped

## Step 2: QIIME quality filtering

## Step 3: Denoising using DADA2

## Step 4: Merge sequences (necessary if multiple separate sequencing runs were performed)

## Step 5: Assigning taxonomy using PR2
